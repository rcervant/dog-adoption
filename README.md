## Getting Started with the Dog Matching App ‚¨ÜÔ∏è

Getting started with the Dog Matching App is simple. Just follow these steps:

### 1. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Node.js (v18.7+) installed on your machine. Then, proceed to install the project dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

Before running the app, you'll need to set up a few configuration files:

- **`.env.local`**: This file contains Next.js-specific environment variables.
- **`.env`**: Prisma relies on this file to access the database URL.
- **`.env.template` (provided)**: Contains variables needed for both **`.env.local`** and **`.env`**.

Create duplicate copies of **`.env.template`** and name them **`.env.local`** and **`.env`**. Fill in the required information in these files.

#### .env.local
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_ORIGIN = "http://localhost:3000"
NEXT_PUBLIC_FETCH_COOKIE_NAME=<FOUND IN EXERCISE INSTRUCTIONS>
NEXT_PUBLIC_FETCH_API_URL=<FOUND IN EXERCISE INSTRUCTIONS>
```
#### .env
```bash
DATABASE_URL=
```
### 2. Setting Up the Database

You have two options for setting up the database:

#### [1] Local Setup with Docker

- Start by installing Docker Desktop (macOS/windows) or Docker Engine (Linux). [Install Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)

- Run the following command in a new terminal to initialize the Docker container with a MySQL database:

**macOS/Linux**
```bash
  npm run db:init
```
   **Windows**
```bash
  npm run db:init-win
```

Now, you have a MySQL database running in a Docker container with the following credentials:

- Database name: my_db
- Database password: password
- Port exposed: 3306

To connect to the database with Prisma, run the following command in a new terminal:
```bash
npm run prisma:init
```
#### [2] Local Setup with a Cloud Provider

You can also run the app locally with a MySQL database provided by a cloud service like [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/docs/tutorials/planetscale-quick-start-guide) or [Railway](https://docs.railway.app/databases/mysql). Replace the **`DATABASE_URL`** in **`.env`** with the URL provided by the cloud provider.

```bash
npm run prisma:init
```

### 3. Running the App

You're now ready to run the app:
```bash
npm run dev
```
The app will be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) in your web browser.
